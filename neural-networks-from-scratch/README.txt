This code predicts handwritten digits using the MNIST image dataset, found at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ , using a neural network with one hidden layer. The neural network has been coded practically from scratch, with the code being vectorized, as well as parametrized to be able to re-use the code for other applications. The current prediction accuracy is ~93.7%, which can possibly be improved by tweaking (increasing) the regularization parameter as well as the number of hidden nodes. The code will likely take a long time to run (~5-10 mins on my Mac Book Air with 1.4 GHz Intel Core i5 processor).
