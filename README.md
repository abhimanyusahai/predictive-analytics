# predictive-analytics
(Mostly Python) implementation of predictive analytics models and data science problems

Date Updated: 31 Aug, 2016

This repository contains Python 2.7 code written by me to implement a wide range of problems/models in data science
and predictive analytics. It currently contains the following directories:

1. "machine learning-coursera-andrew-ng" which is a collection of most of the programming assignments in Andrew Ng's course
on Machine Learning from Coursera. It contains Python 2.7 code to solve these assignments.

2. "neural-networks-from-scratch" which is Python 2.7 code that I've written to implement a neural network from scratch. 
This model has then been used to predict handwritten digits over the MNIST database.
